# Plutonium Caverns (Pascal port)
 A port of the Plutonium Caverns for DOS by Jani Nykänen to Pascal language.
Compile and run this under DOS or DOSBox using Turbo Pascal or TMT Pascal. 

Original git: https://github.com/jani-nykanen/plutonium-caverns

* Only the source codes are availablle, in 8.3 format. No LFN needed.
* Text strings are limited to 255 characters. Ofcourse, I use standard Pascal strings.
* Memory leaks are completely fixed.
* TP/BP and TMT generate smaller binary file size.

Why am I doing this? Two months of pandemic lockdown in Saigon, so I have a lot of spare time.

Thank goes to Jani Nykänen.

## Building
Just type: 'TPC PC.PAS' or 'TMTPC PC.PAS' to compile the source code. The MAKEFILE is also available.
